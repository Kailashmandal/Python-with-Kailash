# while loop is used to run a block code multiple time without knowing that how many times we have to run the loop like in for loop

# for exam ple if want to print  a statement 10 times then

i =1  # initailizing i with 1
while i<=10 : # here we provide a condition for run loop
    print("This is while loop.") # the repeative task you want to execute multiple times.
    i=i+1 # here we have to use the statement that will increase the value of i

print("the value of i now is ",i)
